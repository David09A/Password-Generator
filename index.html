      <div class="tip"><h3>Security tips to avoid data theft and vulnerable passwords</h3></div>
      <div class="tip">- Do not use the same password, security question and answer for multiple important accounts.
      </div>
      <div class="tip">- Use a password that has at least 12 characters, use at least one number, one uppercase letter,
         one
         lowercase letter and one special symbol.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Do not use the names of your families, friends or pets in your passwords.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Do not use postcodes, house numbers, phone numbers, birthdates, ID card numbers, social
         security
         numbers, and so on in your passwords.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Do not use two or more similar passwords which most of their characters are same.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Do not use something that can be cloned( but you can't change ) as your passwords, such as your
         fingerprints.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Do not let your Web browsers( FireFox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE, Microsoft Edge ) to store
         your
         passwords, since all passwords saved in Web browsers can be revealed easily.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Do not log in to important accounts on the computers of others, or when connected to a public
         Wi-Fi
         hotspot.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Do not send sensitive information online via unencrypted( e.g. HTTP or FTP ) connections,
         because
         messages in these connections can be sniffed with very little effort. You should use encrypted connections such
         as
         HTTPS, SFTP, FTPS, SMTPS, IPSec whenever possible.</div>
      <div class="tip">- To check the strength of your passwords and know whether they're inside the popular rainbow
         tables,
         you can convert your passwords to MD5 hashes on a MD5 hash generator, then decrypt your passwords by submitting
         these
         hashes to an online MD5 decryption service. For instance, your password is "0123456789A", using the brute-force
         method, it may take a computer almost one year to crack your password, but if you decrypt it by submitting its
         MD5
         hash( C8E7279CD035B23BB9C0F1F954DFF5B3 ) to a MD5 decryption website, how long will it take to crack it? You
         can
         perform the test yourself.</div>
      <div class="tip">- It's recommended to change your passwords every 10 weeks.</div>
      <div class="tip">- It's recommended that you remember a few master passwords, store other passwords in a plain
         text file
         and encrypt this file with 7-Zip, GPG or a disk encryption software such as BitLocker, or manage your passwords
         with
         a password management software.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Encrypt and backup your passwords to different locations, then if you lost access to your
         computer or
         account, you can retrieve your passwords back quickly.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Turn on 2-step authentication whenever possible.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Do not store your critical passwords in the cloud.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Access important websites( e.g. Paypal ) from bookmarks directly, otherwise please check its
         domain
         name carefully.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Protect your computer with firewall and antivirus software, block all incoming connections and
         all
         unnecessary outgoing connections with the firewall. Download software from reputable sites only, and verify the
         MD5 /
         SHA1 / SHA256 checksum or GPG signature of the installation package whenever possible.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Keep the operating systems( e.g. Windows 7, Windows 10, Mac OS X, iOS, Linux ) and Web
         browsers( e.g.
         FireFox, Chrome, IE, Microsoft Edge ) of your devices( e.g. Windows PC, Mac PC, iPhone, iPad, Android tablet )
         up-to-date by installing the latest security update.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Lock your computer and mobile phone when you leave them. </div>
      <div class="tip">- Encrypt the entire hard drive with VeraCrypt, FileVault, LUKS or similar tools before putting
         important files on it, and destroy the hard drive of your old devices physically if it's necessary.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Access important websites in private or incognito mode, or use one Web browser to access
         important
         websites, use another one to access other sites. Or access unimportant websites and install new software inside
         a
         virtual machine created with VMware, VirtualBox or Parallels.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Use at least 3 different email addresses, use the first one to receive emails from important
         sites
         and Apps, such as Paypal and Amazon, use the second one to receive emails from unimportant sites and Apps, use
         the
         third one( from a different email provider, such as Outlook and GMail ) to receive your password-reset email
         when the
         first one( e.g. Yahoo Mail ) is hacked.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Use at least 2 differnet phone numbers, do NOT tell others the phone number which you use to
         receive
         text messages of the verification codes.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Do not click the link in an email or SMS message, do not reset your passwords by clicking them,
         except that you know these messages are not fake.</div>
      <div class="tip">- Do not tell your passwords to anybody in the email.</div>
      <div class="tip">- It's possible that one of the software or App you downloaded or updated has been modified by
         hackers,
         you can avoid this problem by not installing this software or App at the first time, except that it's published
         to
         fix security holes. You can use Web based apps instead, which are more secure and portable.</div>
